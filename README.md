## Maker, Breaker, and Professional Eater of Bread

I'm just a guy who hopes to leave the world a little better than I found it.

### Some work I'm proud of:

- [Spiderweb]
  - I realized I didn't know how web frameworks worked, so I wrote one!
  - mix between Django and Flask
  - lots of great features for making rockin' apps
  - fully functional ~~micro~~ smallish web framework, just large enough to hold a spider
  - [full writeup here!]

- [FilamentColors.xyz]
  - 3D printer filament color matching database
  - Every manufacturer photographs their filaments differently -- why not have a single place that photographs them all the same?
  - Automatically generates relative color matches for projects up to four colors ([example!])
  - Completely free and [open source!] 

- [Grafeas Group, Ltd.] (a.k.a. TranscribersOfReddit)
  - [Open source on GitHub!]
  - 501(c)3 international nonprofit founded to increase accessibility on the internet by using gamification to power crowdsourced transcriptions of inaccessible content (images, videos, and audio)
  - Featured in [WIRED] and [WIRED UK]!
  - 5,950+ volunteers with 277,500+ posts transcribed for those who need them

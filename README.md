## Maker, Breaker, and Professional Eater of Bread

I'm just a guy who hopes to leave the world a little better than I found it.

### Some work I'm proud of:

- [Grafeas Group, Ltd.](https://grafeas.org)
  - [Open source on GitHub!](https://github.com/grafeasgroup)
  - 501(c)3 international nonprofit founded to increase accessibility on the internet by using gamification to power crowdsourced transcriptions of inaccessible content (images, videos, and audio)
  - Home base: https://reddit.com/r/transcribersofreddit
  - Featured in [WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/online-altruists-are-making-reddit-more-accessible/) and [WIRED UK](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/transcribers-of-reddit)!
  - over 3500 volunteers, 110,000+ posts transcribed for those who need them

- [FilamentColors.xyz](https://filamentcolors.xyz)
  - 3D printer filament color matching database
  - Every manufacturer photographs their filaments differently -- why not have a single place that photographs them all the same?
  - Automatically generates relative color matches for projects up to four colors ([example!](https://filamentcolors.xyz/library/collection/464,359,117,171/))
  - Completely free and [open source!](https://github.com/itsthejoker/filamentcolors.xyz)
